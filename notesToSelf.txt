=======================DIFFERENCES BETWEEN REACT AND ANGULAR=======================

1. Type
React: A library for building user interfaces.
Angular: A full-fledged framework with built-in features for routing, HTTP, forms, etc.

2. Language
React: Uses JavaScript, often with JSX (JavaScript + XML-like syntax).
Angular: Uses TypeScript, a statically-typed superset of JavaScript.

3. Architecture
React: Purely component-based.
Angular: Component-based, but includes services, modules, and dependency injection.

4. Learning Curve
React: Easier to get started with, but more decisions left up to the developer.
Angular: Steeper learning curve due to more built-in concepts and conventions.

5. Data Binding
React: Primarily one-way data binding (from state to view).
Angular: Supports two-way data binding (view and model stay in sync).

6. DOM Handling
React: Uses a Virtual DOM to optimize rendering.
Angular: Uses the real DOM, with change detection mechanisms.

7. Flexibility
React: Very flexible — you choose your own router, state manager, etc.
Angular: More opinionated — encourages a specific architecture and tools.

8. Use Case
React: Ideal for building fast, interactive UIs — especially SPAs.
Angular: Often used for large-scale enterprise applications.

9. Community & Ecosystem
React: Massive community, tons of third-party packages.
Angular: Strong backing by Google, fewer third-party decisions to make thanks to built-in tools.

=================================UPDATING STATE=================================

-There are two options for updating state in Angular:

  1. Relying on Zone.js & Angular's change detection mechanism
    * works automatically
  2. Using Signals to notify Angular about value changes & required UI updates
    * requires usage of special 'signal' instructions & code
    * 'signals' are objects that store a value (any type, including nested objects)
    * introduced with Angular v16
